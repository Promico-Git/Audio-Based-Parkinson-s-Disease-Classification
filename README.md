# Parkinson-s-Disease-Audio-Classification
This project focuses on classifying Parkinson's disease using audio recordings. It implements two different deep learning models: a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that works with Mel spectrograms, and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM cells that processes MFCC features.
